Here is a brief description of **Conway's [Game of Life][]** from Wikipedia:

> The **Game of Life**, also known simply as **Life**, is a cellular automaton devised
> by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player
> game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state,
> requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating
> an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete
> and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.

It is one of more intersting topics not only in Computer Science but also
within the programming community - for it is facinating to observe how little deviation in the initial condition can propagate and disrupt the entire system.

This project is a self-interest driven study project focused on creating the
simulation environment for _Game of Life_ in Python3.
